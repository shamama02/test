Algorithms - Step by step procedure of solving a problem.
### Difference between Algorithms and Programs
#### Design Time – Algorithm 
1. Written at design time
2. Any language i.e., English + Mathematical notations
3. Who – Domain knowledge
4. Hardware & Software independent
5. Analyze the algorithm in terms of time and space
#### Implementation Time – Program 
1. Written at implementation time
2. Written in a programming language i.e., C++, Java
3. Who - Programmers 
4. Hardware & Software independent
5. Test the program
